							<h2>Payments</h2>
							<p>In a previous project, the EY team was responsible for delivering an SAP Financial Products Subledger solution to a large fintech payments client. As their payment and credit business resulted in the addition of new source systems and accounting requirements, this requires configurations to the system. In a business analyst role, Abhishek created client presentation materials and analysis spreadsheets to show the design strategy and accounting simplification efforts for a key data migration initiative for their payment and credit business. Additionally, he was responsible for the documentation of several technical processes and oversaw the development status meetings to track and escalate risks accordingly. </p>

							<h2>Insurance Digital Transformation</h2>
							<p>The EY project team was helping the client undergo a large data migration effort to shift away from existing legacy systems and build up their own internal database for all life insurance and annuity products. As a data analyst on the team, Abhishek was responsible for requirements analysis, data attribute mapping and communicating effectively between development teams and other business stakeholders. Abhishek has created mapping documents that illustrate the flow of data from the backend database to the frontend consumer platforms to aid the QA teams for both regression and unit testing purposes. </p>
